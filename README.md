(As a lab prject we are committed to submit a manuscript which is based on the overall theme as described below)
Urbanization can alter plant processes by creating distinct microclimates characterized by higher temperatures and altered light conditions, humidity, and precipitation. In particular, urban plants may shift the timing of seasonal life history events due to these unique conditions, but this process is understudied, particularly in the tropics. We propose to combine phenological data across rural-urban gradients in South Asia, which we will glean from iNaturalist and SeasonWatch citizen science observations, with functional trait data from the global TRY database in order to predict speciesâ€™ phenological plasticity across space. We will use species selection and image annotation methods developed by one of the authors to extract phenological information. Using this phenology data along with trait and climate data, the research will explore trait-environment interactions that drive phenological changes along rural-urban gradients.
